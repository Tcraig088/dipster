# 1. TDDIP-ET
TDDIP-ET (Time Dependent Deep Image Priors -  Electron Tomography)
Time dependent deep image priors (TDDIP) is a novel machine learning technique to determine time resolved reconstructed data from initial projections. This library is a specific implementation of TDDIP for reconstructing 3D reconstructions from 2D projections obtained through electron microscopy. 

Currently no documentation is available for this library. 

## 1.2. Installation 
This package can be installed through conda using the following command.

```bash
    conda create -n <new_env>
    conda activate

    conda install tomosipo pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=<x.x> pytorch-cuda=<x.x> -c aahendriksen -c astra-toolbox -c pytorch -c nvidia
    conda install tddipet -c Tcraig088
```
Current installation has been tested with pytorch 2.0.1  and cudatoolkit/pytorch cuda 11.7.

## 1.3. Usage 


```python
    import tddipet as tet

    #load in tiltseries data
    opt = tet.Option(data)
    solver = tet.Solver()
    solver.fit(data)

    # reconstruct your data set at a specific point in time
    recon = solver.reconstruct(time)
```
