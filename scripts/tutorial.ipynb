    "\n",
    "For setting up a DIP-STER experiment the tilt series / sinogram is required. This can be imported using the tomobase submodule of the Time Dependent Tomography library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to monitor the training process by default the SSIM and loss are monitored every 100 cycles. This is achieved using [WandB](https://wandb.ai/site/). If a volume-time series is avalaible, orthoslices can be visually compared to the volume time series. Volume time series can be imported using the tomobase submodule of the Time Dependent Tomography library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its worth noting that the data must be reformatted from the default of the Time Dependent Tomography Library. By convention, the Time Dependent Tomography library utilize an image format of (n, x, z) whereas DIP-STER is (z, x, n). The convert function will by default correct this and convert the dataset to use Pytorch which is unsupported in the data processing library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure all image dimensions (except number of projections) is a multiple of 2. By default the network supports images of 128 pixels but can support any dimensions fulfilling this requirement with optimization. "
